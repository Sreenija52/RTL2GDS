# RISC V based VSDBabySOC RTL-to-GDSII Implementation

This project is my journey into the world of chip design — building a RISC-V based System-on-Chip (SoC) from scratch and taking it all the way to tapeout.
It covers from RTL design, synthesis, floorplanning, place-and-route(physical design) and finally GDSII generation. Think of it as turning lines of Verilog into a chip you can actually fabricate!
The repo holds my RTL code, testbenches, synthesis, PnR scripts and documentation capturing not just the flow but also the learning experience of being part of a real tapeout program with VSD.

## 1. System-on-Chip (SoC)

A **System-on-Chip (SoC)** is a **mini computer integrated on a single chip**, combining CPU, memory, peripherals, and interconnects into a compact form. This integration allows devices to perform complex tasks while maintaining small form factor and low power consumption. SoCs are widely used in mobile devices, embedded systems, and IoT applications due to their versatility and efficiency.

## 2. Key Components of a SoC

A typical **System-on-Chip (SoC)** integrates several essential components on a single chip. These components work together to perform computation, store data, and interact with external devices. The main components include:

**A. CPU (Central Processing Unit)**  
   - The brain of the SoC that executes instructions and manages operations.  
   - Can be single-core or multi-core depending on performance needs.  
   - Coordinates all other components and handles data processing tasks.

**B. Memory**  
   - **RAM (Random Access Memory):** Temporary storage for data and instructions, allowing fast access during program execution.  
   - **ROM (Read-Only Memory):** Permanent storage for firmware, boot instructions, or system configuration data.

**C. Peripherals / Input-Output (I/O)**  
   - Interfaces to connect the SoC with external devices such as sensors, displays, communication modules, and user interfaces.  
   - Examples include UART, SPI, I2C interfaces, GPIOs, ADCs, and DACs.

**D. Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)**  
   - Responsible for creating visuals on your screen.  
   - Used for gaming, watching videos, or any activity involving images or animations.

**E. Digital Signal Processor (DSP)**  
   - Specialized in processing audio and video signals.  
   - Helps with tasks like noise reduction in phone calls or enhancing video quality.

**F. Power Management**  
   - Regulates power usage within the SoC, ensuring efficient operation.  
   - Crucial for extending battery life in portable devices.

**G. Special Features**  
   - Additional features may include Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and security modules for safe data handling.  
   - These features vary depending on the specific purpose of the SoC.
